(** Streams.

    See {{:https://aantron.github.io/luv/networking.html#tcp} {i TCP}} in the
    user guide and {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html} [uv_stream_t]
    {i â€” Stream handle}} in libuv.

    Several types of {{!Luv.Handle.t} handle} have a portion of their interface
    in common, which portion is abstracted out into this module {!Luv.Stream}.

    Concrete streams are:

    - {!Luv.Pipe.t}
    - {!Luv.TCP.t}
    - {!Luv.TTY.t} *)

type 'kind t = [ `Stream of 'kind ] Handle.t
(** Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_stream_t}
    [uv_stream_t]}. *)

val shutdown : _ t -> ((unit, Error.t) result -> unit) -> unit
(** Shuts down the write side of the stream.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_shutdown}
    [uv_shutdown]}. See
    {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shutdown.3p.html}
    [shutdown(3p)]}. *)

val listen :
  ?backlog:int -> _ t -> ((unit, Error.t) result -> unit) -> unit
(** Starts listening for incoming connections.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_listen}
    [uv_listen]}. See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/listen.3p.html}
    [listen(3p)]}.

    The default value of [?backlog] is [SOMAXCONN]. *)

val accept : server:'kind t -> client:'kind t -> (unit, Error.t) result
(** Accepts an incoming connection.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_accept}
    [uv_accept]}. See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/accept.3p.html}
    [accept(3p)]}.

    [~client] should be a freshly-initialized stream of the same kind as
    [~server]. In other words, if [~server] is a {!Luv.TCP.t}, [~client] should
    also be a {!Luv.TCP.t}, and should have been obtained from
    {!Luv.TCP.init}. *)

val read_start :
  ?allocate:(int -> Buffer.t) ->
  _ t ->
  ((Buffer.t, Error.t) result -> unit) ->
    unit
(** Calls its callback whenever data is available on the stream.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_read_start}
    [uv_read_start]}. See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/read.3p.html}
    [read(3p)]}.

    The amount of data read is equal to the length of the buffer passed to the
    callback.

    [?allocate] is called immediately before each call to the main callback with
    [Ok buffer'], to create [buffer], into which the data will be read.
    [buffer'] is, in general, a {{!Luv.Buffer.sub} view} into [buffer]. The
    default [?allocate] allocates a fresh buffer every time it is called. One
    particular use of [?allocate] is to always read data into the same
    pre-existing buffer. The [int] argument passed to [?allocate] is a suggested
    size. It is acceptable to return a buffer of a smaller size. To read into an
    existing buffer, but not at its beginning, use {!Luv.Buffer.sub} to create a
    view into the buffer.

    The end of the stream (typically, when the remote peer closes or shuts down
    the connection) is indicated by [Error `EOF] being passed to the callback.
    Note that this behavior is different from {!Luv.File.read}.

    Zero-length reads are possible, and do not indicate the end of stream.
    Instead, they usually indicate [EAGAIN] inside libuv; libuv still calls the
    callback in order to give the C user a chance to deallocate the data buffer.
    This is not usually an issue in OCaml, so a wrapper of this function can
    usually simply ignore zero-length reads. It is then also safe to convert
    [Error `EOF] to zero-length reads in a higher-level API, for consistency
    with reading files, and in accordance with OS API convention.

    To read only once, call {!Luv.Stream.read_stop} immediately, in the main
    callback. Otherwise, the main callback will be called repeatedly. *)

val read_stop : _ t -> (unit, Error.t) result
(** Stops reading.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_read_stop}
    [uv_read_stop]}. *)

val write :
  _ t -> Buffer.t list -> ((unit, Error.t) result -> int -> unit) -> unit
(** Writes the given buffer to the stream.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_write} [uv_write]}.
    See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/writev.3p.html} [writev(3p)]}.

    To write only part of a buffer, use {!Luv.Buffer.sub} to create a view into
    the buffer, and pass the view to this function {!Luv.Stream.write}.

    The second argument passed to the callback is the number of bytes
    written. libuv has an internal queue of writes, in part to implement retry.
    This means that writes can be partial at the libuv (and Luv) API level, so
    it is possible to receive both an [Error] result, and for some data to have
    been successfully written. *)

val write2 :
  [< `Pipe ] t -> Buffer.t list -> send_handle:[< `TCP | `Pipe ] t ->
    ((unit, Error.t) result -> int -> unit) -> unit
(** Like {!Luv.Stream.write}, but allows sending a TCP socket or pipe over the
    stream ([~send_handle]). The stream must be a pipe.

    immediately.
