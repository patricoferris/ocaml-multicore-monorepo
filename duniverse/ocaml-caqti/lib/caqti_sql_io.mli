  (** [read_sql_statement read_char chan] reads the next semicolon-terminated
      SQL statement from [chan], taking care to skip over quoted semicolons.
      [read_char chan] shall return the next character from [chan], or [None]
      when the end of file has been reached.  A final semicolon is optional and
      any trailing white space after it will be ignored.

      This can be used e.g. to read in SQL schemas or schema updates from a file
      for automatic initialization and updates of tables, sequences, functions,
      views, etc. *)
