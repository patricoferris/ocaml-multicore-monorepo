      Do not use pooling for connections to volatile resources like
      [sqlite3::memory:] and beware of temporary tables or other objects which
      may not be shared across connections to the same URI.

      If you use preemptive threading, note that the connection pool must only
      be used from the thread where it was created. Use thread local storage to
      create a separate pool per thread if necessary.

      @param max_size
        The maximum number of open connections. Must be at least [1].
        For drivers which does not support concurrent connections, this will be
        ignored and the value [1] used instead.

      @param max_idle_size
        The maximum number of idle connections to put into the pool for reuse.
        Defaults to [max_size]. Must be between 0 and [max_size]. If you set
        this, you must also set [max_size].
        For drivers which does not support pooling, this will be ignored and the
        value [0] used instead. For drivers which does not support concurrent
        connections, but supports pooling, the value will clipped to a maximum
        of [1]. *)
