  (** {b Internal:} [create alloc free] is a pool of resources allocated by
      [alloc] and freed by [free]. This is primarily intended for implementing
      the [connect_pool] functions.

      @param max_size
        The maximum number of allocated resources.

      @param max_idle_size
        The maximum number of resources to pool for later use. Defaults to
        [max_size].

      @param check
        A function used to check a resource after use.

      @param validate
        A function to check before use that a resource is still valid. *)

  val size : ('a, 'e) t -> int
  (** [size pool] is the current number of open resources in [pool]. *)

  val use :
    ?priority: float ->
    ('a -> ('b, 'e) result future) -> ('a, 'e) t -> ('b, 'e) result future
  (** [use f pool] calls [f] on a resource drawn from [pool], handing back the
      resource to the pool when [f] exits.

      @param priority
        Requests for the resource are handled in decreasing order of priority.
        The default priority is [0.0]. *)

  val drain : ('a, 'e) t -> unit future
  (** [drain pool] closes all resources in [pool]. The pool is still usable, as
      new resources will be created on demand. *)
