## v1.6.0 - 2021-06-10

- Set the time zone of PostgreSQL connections to UTC to mitigate an
  undesirable implicit conversion to the local time zone for `timestamp`.
  This issue was exposed by the specification of field types introduced in
  version 1.4.0.  Earlier versions worked as expected, if only accidentally,
  since the time zone is ignored when a string is converted to a
  `timestamp`.  While this change makes `timestamp` more usable again for
  storing UTC time stamps, I strongly recommend using `timestamp with time
  zone` since it's interpretation is unambiguous.  The API reference is now
  updated with details about how the `ptime` OCaml type is mapped for
  different database systems.
- Drop specification of OCaml `string` as SQL `text` for PostgreSQL. This is
  due to issues with implicit conversions and function overloading when the
  desired type on the SQL side is `char`, `varchar`, or `jsonb`.
- Add `Caqti_type.redact` to protect sensitive information from being
  logged.
- Only log parameters if `$CAQTI_DEBUG_PARAM` is set to "`true`".
- When logging requests, show underlying values for custom types.
- Reject multi-row response in `find_opt` implementation for sqlite3.
- Tolerate Lwt promise rejections in `Pool.use`.

  cause deadlock due to pool exhaustion.

## v0.8.1 - 2017-12-06

- Fix `start` transaction for PostgreSQL v2.
- Fix dependency on ptime in `caqti.opam` in distribution.

## v0.8.0 - 2017-12-04

- Remove most deprecations.
- Add new v2 API.
- Move away most of the v1 API, but keep deprecated aliases for the client
  API.

The main difference of the new API compared to the old is:

- It uses typed parameters and rows with an extensible variant for field
  type and a custom definable compound type.
- The connection has a `call` method which gives access to a result object
  before iterating over the returned rows.
- Error handling is done with the `result` type, using a collection of error
  types formed as polymorphic variants of records.

*Notice:* This version is mostly backwards compatible.  New code should use
v2, but v1 will be kept for now.  To keep using the v1 in upcoming releases:

- Fix the new deprecations from this release.
- Link with `caqti-dynload` to keep using dynamic loading, or link with the
  needed `caqti-driver-*.v1` driver libraries.
- Link with `caqti.v1` instead of `caqti`.
- Link with `caqti-lwt.v1` instead of `caqti-lwt`.
- Link with `caqti-async.v1` instead of `caqti-async`.

## v0.7.0 - 2017-11-03

- Remove deprecated findlib aliases.
- Renamed `date` and `utc` conversions to `date_cl` and `utc_cl`.
- Deprecate `Caqti_metadata` in favour of the new `Caqti_driver_info`.
- Move various signature to separate files, leaving deprecated aliases.

## v0.6.0 - 2017-06-05

- Split into separate packages to avoid depopts and rename findlib names
  accordingly.
- Use findlib to load DB drivers, and use `-linkall`. This hopefully solves
  loading issues.
