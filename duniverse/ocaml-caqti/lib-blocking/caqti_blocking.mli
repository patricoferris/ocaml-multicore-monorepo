(** Blocking API based on the Unix module.

    {e Warning:}  This module is not well tested.  Please report any issues.

    This module implements a blocking API.  It is not designed for preemptive
    threading.  That is, connections and connection pools must be created and
    used within a single thread, and any limitation on multithreading from the
    driver or client library applies.

    You can use a connection pool to cache a single DB connection, additional
    connections will not be allocated, since usage is serial. *)

include Caqti_connect_sig.S with type 'a future = 'a

val or_fail : ('a, [< Caqti_error.t]) result -> 'a
(** Takes [Ok x] to [x] and raises {!Caqti_error.Exn err} on [Error err]. *)
