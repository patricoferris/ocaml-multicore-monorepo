      @param close_unix If [true], closing [t] also closes [fd].
                        If [false], the caller is responsible for closing [fd],
                        which must not happen until after [t] is closed.
      @param seekable If true, we pass [-1] as the file offset, to use the current offset.
                      If false, pass [0] as the file offset, which is needed for sockets. *)

      @param file_offset Read from the given position in [fd] (default: 0).

  (** [write fd buf len] writes exactly [len] bytes from [buf] to [fd].

  val accept : sw:Switch.t -> FD.t -> (FD.t * Unix.sockaddr)
  (** [accept ~sw t] blocks until a new connection is received on listening socket [t].
      It returns the new connection and the address of the connecting peer.
      The new connection has the close-on-exec flag set automatically.

      not already closed manually by then. *)

  val shutdown : FD.t -> Unix.shutdown_command -> unit
  (** Like {!Unix.shutdown}. *)

  (** {1 Randomness} *)

  val getrandom : Cstruct.t -> int
  (**[ getrandom buf] reads some random bytes into [buf] and returns the number of bytes written.
     It uses Linux's [getrandom] call, which is like reading from /dev/urandom
     except that it will block (the whole domain) if used at early boot
     when the random system hasn't been initialised yet. *)
