(** Effects based parallel IO for OCaml.

    Eio provides support for concurrency (juggling many tasks) and
    parallelism (using multiple CPU cores for performance).

    It provides facilities for creating and coordinating fibers (light-weight
    threads) and domains (for parallel processing), as well as interfaces for
    interacting with resources provided by the operating system.

    These features must be used within an {e event loop},
    provided by an Eio {e backend}.
    Applications can use {!Eio_main.run} to run a suitable loop.

    See {{:https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio}} for a tutorial. *)

(** {1 Concurrency primitives} *)

(** Grouping fibers and other resources so they can be turned off together. *)
module Switch : sig
  (** Many resources in Eio (such as fibers and file handles) require a switch to
      be provided when they are created. The resource cannot outlive its switch.

      If a function wants to create such resources, and was not passed a switch
      as an argument, it will need to create a switch using {!run}.
      This doesn't return until all resources attached to it have been freed,
      preventing the function from leaking resources.

      Any function creating resources that outlive it needs to be given a
      switch by its caller.

      Each switch includes its own {!Cancel.t} context.
      Calling {!fail} cancels all fibers attached to the switch and, once they
      have exited, reports the error.

      Note: this concept is known as a "nursery" or "bundle" in some other systems.

      Example:
      {[
         Switch.run (fun sw ->
            let flow = Dir.open_in ~sw dir "myfile.txt" in
            ...
         );
         (* [flow] will have been closed by this point *)
      ]}
  *)

  type t
  (** A switch contains a group of fibers and other resources (such as open file handles). *)

  (** {2 Switch creation} *)

  val run : (t -> 'a) -> 'a
  (** [run fn] runs [fn] with a fresh switch (initially on).

      When [fn] finishes, [run] waits for all fibers registered with the switch to finish,
      and then releases all attached resources.

      If {!fail} is called, [run] will re-raise the exception (after everything is cleaned up).
      If [fn] raises an exception, it is passed to {!fail}. *)

  val run_protected : (t -> 'a) -> 'a
  (** [run_protected fn] is like [run] but ignores cancellation requests from the parent context. *)

  (** {2 Cancellation and failure} *)

  val check : t -> unit
  (** [check t] checks that [t] is still on.
      @raise Cancel.Cancelled If the switch has been cancelled. *)

  val get_error : t -> exn option
  (** [get_error t] is like [check t] except that it returns the exception instead of raising it.
      If [t] is finished, this returns (rather than raising) the [Invalid_argument] exception too. *)

  val fail : ?bt:Printexc.raw_backtrace -> t -> exn -> unit
  (** [fail t ex] adds [ex] to [t]'s set of failures and
      ensures that the switch's cancellation context is cancelled,
      to encourage all fibers to exit as soon as possible.

      [fail] returns immediately, without waiting for the shutdown actions to complete.
      The exception will be raised later by {!run}, and [run]'s caller is responsible for handling it.
      {!Exn.combine} is used to avoid duplicate or unnecessary exceptions.
      @param bt A backtrace to attach to [ex] *)

  (** {2 Cleaning up resources}

      It is possible to attach clean-up hooks to a switch.
      Once all fibres within the switch have finished, these hooks are called.
      For example, when a file is opened it will register a release hook to close it.

      Functions that create such resources will take a switch argument
      and call these functions for you.
      You usually don't need to call these directly. *)

  val on_release : t -> (unit -> unit) -> unit
  (** [on_release t fn] registers [fn] to be called once [t]'s main function has returned
      and all fibers have finished.

      If [fn] raises an exception, it is passed to {!fail}.

      Release handlers are run in LIFO order, in series.

      Note that [fn] is called within a {!Cancel.protect}, since aborting clean-up actions is usually a bad idea
      and the switch may have been cancelled by the time it runs. *)

  type hook
  (** A handle for removing a clean-up callback. *)

  val null_hook : hook
  (** A dummy hook. Removing it does nothing. *)

  val on_release_cancellable : t -> (unit -> unit) -> hook
  (** Like [on_release], but the handler can be removed later.

      For example, opening a file will call [on_release_cancellable] to ensure the file is closed later.
      However, if the file is manually closed before that, it will use {!remove_hook} to remove the hook,
      which is no longer needed. *)

  val remove_hook : hook -> unit
  (** [remove_hook h] removes a previously-added hook.
      If the hook has already been removed, this does nothing. *)

module Promise : sig
  (** Unlike lazy values, you cannot "force" promises;
      a promise is resolved when the maker of the promise is ready.

      Promises are thread-safe and so can be shared between domains and used
      to communicate between them.

      Example:
      {[

        Fiber.both

  (** [resolve u v] resolves [u]'s promise with the value [v].
      Any threads waiting for the result will be added to the run queue.
      @raise Invalid_argument if [u] is already resolved. *)

  val peek : 'a t -> 'a option
  (** [peek t] is [Some v] if the promise has been resolved to [v], or [None] otherwise.
      If the result is [None] then it may change in future, otherwise it won't.
      If another domain has access to the resolver then the state may have already
      changed by the time this call returns. *)

  val resolve_error : ('a, 'b) result u -> 'b -> unit
  (** [resolve_error u x] is [resolve u (Error x)]. *)

  val await_exn : 'a or_exn -> 'a

end

(** A fiber is a light-weight thread. *)
module Fiber : sig
  (** Within a domain, only one fiber can be running at a time.
      A fiber runs until it performs an IO operation (directly or indirectly).
      At that point, it may be suspended and the next fiber on the run queue runs. *)

  val both : (unit -> unit) -> (unit -> unit) -> unit
  (** [both f g] runs [f ()] and [g ()] concurrently.

      They run in a new cancellation sub-context, and
      if either raises an exception, the other is cancelled.
      [both] waits for both functions to finish even if one raises
      (it will then re-raise the original exception).

      [f] runs immediately, without switching to any other thread.
      [g] is inserted at the head of the run-queue, so it runs next even if other threads are already enqueued.
      You can get other scheduling orders by adding calls to {!yield} in various places.
      e.g. to append both fibers to the end of the run-queue, yield immediately before calling [both].

      If both fibers fail, {!Exn.combine} is used to combine the exceptions. *)

      They run in a new cancellation sub-context, and when one finishes the other is cancelled.
      If one raises, the other is cancelled and the exception is reported.

      As with [both], [f] runs immediately and [g] is scheduled next, ahead of any other queued work.

      If both fibers fail, {!Exn.combine} is used to combine the exceptions. *)

      The new fiber is attached to [sw] (which can't finish until the fiber ends).

      The new fiber inherits [sw]'s cancellation context.
      If the fiber raises an exception, [Switch.fail sw] is called.
      If [sw] is already off then [fn] fails immediately, but the calling thread continues.

      [fn] runs immediately, without switching to any other fiber first.

      @param on_error This is called if the fiber raises an exception.
                      If it raises in turn, the parent switch is failed.

      It runs [accept t] in the current fiber and, on success, runs [handle t result] in a new fiber.
      It is useful for e.g. accepting network connections,
      where we need to provide a switch for the new client socket before we have forked,
      but then move it to a child fiber later.

      If [accept] raises an exception then the effect is the same as [Switch.run accept].
      If [handle] raises an exception, it is passed to [on_handler_error].
      If that raises in turn, the parent switch is failed.
      [on_handler_error] is not called if the parent [sw] is itself cancelled. *)

  val fork_promise : sw:Switch.t -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a Promise.or_exn

(** Cancelling fibers. *)
module Cancel : sig
  (** This is the low-level interface to cancellation.
      Every {!Switch} includes a cancellation context and most users will just use that API instead.

      Each domain has a tree of cancellation contexts, and every fiber is registered with one context.
      A fiber can switch to a different context (e.g. by calling {!sub}).
      When a context is cancelled, all registered fibers have their current cancellation function (if any)
      called and removed. Child contexts are cancelled too, recursively, unless marked as protected.

      Many operations also check that the current context hasn't been cancelled,
      so if a fiber is performing a non-cancellable operation it will still get cancelled soon afterwards.
      This check is typically done when starting an operation, not at the end.
      If an operation is cancelled after succeeding, but while still waiting on the run queue,
      it will still return the operation's result.
      A notable exception is {!Fiber.yield}, which checks at the end.
      You can also use {!Fiber.check} to check manually.

      Whether a fiber is cancelled through a cancellation function or by checking its context,
      it will receive a {!Cancelled} exception.
      It is possible the exception will get lost (if something catches it and forgets to re-raise).
      It is also possible to get this exception even when not cancelled, for example by awaiting
      a promise which another fiber has resolved to a cancelled exception.
      When in doubt, use [Fiber.check ()] to find out if your fiber is really cancelled.
      Ideally this should be done any time you have caught an exception and are planning to ignore it,
      although if you forget then the next IO operation will typically abort anyway.

      Quick clean-up actions (such as releasing a mutex or deleting a temporary file) are OK,
      but operations that may block should be avoided.
      For example, a network connection should simply be closed,
      without attempting to send a goodbye message.

      The purpose of the cancellation system is to stop fibers quickly, not to report errors.
      Use {!Switch.fail} instead to record an error. *)

val traceln :

(** [traceln fmt] outputs a debug message (typically to stderr).

    Trace messages are printed by default and do not require logging to be configured first.
    The message is printed with a newline, and is flushed automatically.
    [traceln] is intended for quick debugging rather than for production code.

    Unlike most Eio operations, [traceln] will never switch to another fiber;
    if the OS is not ready to accept the message then the whole domain waits.

    It is safe to call [traceln] from multiple domains at the same time.
    Each line will be written atomically.

    Examples:
    {[
      traceln "x = %d" x;
      traceln "x = %d" x ~__POS__;   (* With location information *)
    ]}
    @param __POS__ Display [__POS__] as the location of the [traceln] call. *)

      - Combining with a {!Cancel.Cancelled} exception does nothing, as these don't need to be reported.
        The result is only [Cancelled] if there is no other exception available.
      - If [x] is a [Multiple] exception then [y] is added to it, to avoid nested [Multiple] exceptions.
      - Duplicate exceptions are removed (using physical equality of the exception). *)

    (** {2 Cancellation}

        The {!Cancel} module describes the user's view of cancellation.

        Internally, when the user calls a primitive operation that needs to block the fiber,
        the [Suspend callback] effect is performed.
        This suspends the fiber and calls [callback] from the scheduler's context,
        passing it the suspended fiber's context.
        If the operation can be cancelled,
        the callback should use {!set_cancel_fn} to register a cancellation function.

        There are two possible outcomes for the operation: it may complete normally,
        or it may be cancelled.
        If it is cancelled then the registered cancellation function is called.
        This function will always be called from the fiber's own domain, but care must be taken
        if the operation is being completed by another domain at the same time.

        Consider the case of {!Stream.take}, which can be fulfilled by a {!Stream.add} from another domain.
        We want to ensure that either the item is removed from the stream and returned to the waiting fiber,
        or that the operation is cancelled and the item is not removed from the stream.

        Therefore, cancelling and completing both attempt to clear the cancel function atomically,
        so that only one can succeed. The case where [Stream.take] succeeds before cancellation:

        + A fiber calls [Suspend] and is suspended.
          The callback sets a cancel function and registers a waiter on the stream.
        + When another domain has an item, it removes the cancel function (making the [take] uncancellable)
          and begins resuming the fiber with the new item.
        + If the taking fiber is cancelled after this, the cancellation will be ignored and the operation
          will complete successfully. Future operations will fail immediately, however.

        The case of cancellation winning the race:

        + A fiber calls [Suspend] and is suspended.
          The callback sets a cancel function and registers a waiter on the stream.
        + The taking fiber is cancelled. Its cancellation function is called, which starts removing the waiter.
        + If another domain tries to provide an item to the waiter as this is happening,
          it will try to clear the cancel function and fail.
          The item will be given to the next waiter instead.

        Note that there is a mutex around the list of waiters, so the taking domain
        can't finish removing the waiter and start another operation while the adding
        domain is trying to resume it.
        In future, we may want to make this lock-free by using a fresh atomic
        to hold the cancel function for each operation.

        Note: A fiber will only have a cancel function set while it is suspended. *)

    val cancellation_context : t -> Cancel.t
    (** [cancellation_context t] is [t]'s current cancellation context. *)

    val set_cancel_fn : t -> (exn -> unit) -> unit
    (** [set_cancel_fn t fn] sets [fn] as the fiber's cancel function.

        If the cancellation context is cancelled, the function is removed and called.
        When the operation completes, you must call {!clear_cancel_fn} to remove it. *)

    val clear_cancel_fn : t -> bool
    (** [clear_cancel_fn t] removes the function previously set with {!set_cancel_fn}, if any.

        Returns [true] if this call removed the function, or [false] if there wasn't one.
        This operation is atomic and thread-safe.
        An operation that completes in another domain must use this to indicate that the operation is
        finished (can no longer be cancelled) before enqueuing the result. If it returns [false],
        the operation was cancelled first and the canceller has called (or is calling) the function.
        If it returns [true], the caller is responsible for any resources owned by the function,
        such as the continuation. *)
