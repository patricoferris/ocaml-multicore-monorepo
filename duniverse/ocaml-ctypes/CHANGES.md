## ctypes 0.6.1

### Bug fixes

* Fix constructor qualification in code generated for inverted stubs:  
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/397

## ctypes 0.6.0

### Features

* The `Cstubs.FOREIGN` interface has been extended with `returning` and `@->`, and some new types.  
  See the pull request for details:  
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/389

  NB: code that generates bindings using `Cstubs` may need to be updated to select `return` and `@->` from the bindings functor argument rather than from the `Ctypes` module.  Code that needs to be updated will fail to compile with the new interface.  The pull request shows how to update your code, if necessary.

* The `Cstubs` module can now generate asynchronous bindings to C functions using the Lwt jobs framework.  
  See the pull request for details:  
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/391

* The `Cstubs` module now supports optionally returning `errno` alongside the return value of bound C functions.  
  See the pull request for details:  
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/392

* Cross-compilation support is improved: the configuration step no longer runs binaries on the host.  
  See the pull request for details:  
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/383

* The `Unsigned.S` interface has new `of_int64` and `to_int64` functions.

### Compatibility

* The deprecated `*:*` and `+:+` functions have been removed.  Use `Ctypes.field` instead.

* OCaml 4.00.* is no longer supported.  The earliest supported OCaml release is 4.01.0

Thanks to Spiros Eliopoulos (@seliopou), @orbitz, Leonid Rozenberg (@rleonid) and Peter Zotov (@whitequark) for contributions to this release.

## ctypes 0.5.1

### Bug fixes

* Use a C function, not `Pervasives.ignore`, to keep values alive.

## ctypes 0.5.0

Thanks to Andreas Hauptmann (@fdopen), David Sheets (@dsheets), Etienne Millon (@emillon), Goswin von Brederlow (@mrvn), Leonid Rozenberg (@rleonid), @orbitz, Max Mouratov (@cakeplus), and Peter Zotov (@whitequark) for contributions to this release.

* Expose larger interfaces for POSIX types known to be integer types.

* Add support for 1- and 2-byte unsigned integer typedefs.

* Support signed arithmetic operations for `ssize_t`.

* Add support for `ptrdiff_t` as a typedef for a signed integer type.

* Support `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` as typedefs

* Support coercions between object and function pointers.

* Add public `funptr_of_raw_address` function.

* Support `static_funptr` coercions

* Add function pointers to the core type language

  (See the `Ctypes_static.static_funptr` type, on which
  `Foreign.funptr` and `Foreign.foreign` are now based.)

* Better support for functions returning void with inverted stubs.

* Add support for releasing runtime lock to Cstubs_inverted.

### Bug fixes

* Fix: inconsistent use of `caml_stat_*` functions

* Fix: a memory leak in `ctypes_caml_roots_release`

## ctypes 0.4.2

  There is now support for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit, using MinGW) and automatic building and testing on Windows using [Appveyor][appveyor-builds]. 

* Support for releasing the runtime lock in C calls

  The new `release_runtime_lock` argument to `Foreign.foreign` indicates whether the OCaml runtime lock should be released during the call to the bound C function, allowing other threads to run.

* Support for acquiring the runtime lock in callbacks

  There is a  new `runtime_lock` argument to `Foreign.funptr`.  Setting `runtime_lock` to `true` indicates that the OCaml runtime lock should be acquired during calls from C to OCaml and released during calls through function pointers from OCaml to C.

* Support for passing 'bytes' values directly to C

  See the [relevant section of the FAQ][strings_faq].

* Add support for custom printers in views.

* Optionally obtain struct and union layout from C

#### Other changes
* string_opt wraps char *, not void *.
* Remove some poorly-supported POSIX types
* Use nativeint to represent pointers
* Support zero-argument callbacks
* findlib package naming: ctypes.foreign-base ~> ctypes.foreign.base &c.
* Make it possible to print a field name
* Better exception handling when using RTLD_NOLOAD
* RTLD_LOCAL support
* Changed the #include path to $(ocamlfind query ctypes)
* Renamed some internal modules to avoid name clashes
