`;;` is not mandatory at the end of toplevel phrases but will be inserted
automatically in the corrected file. Also, a warning will be emitted.

```ocaml
# let x = 3;;
val x : int = 3
# let f = function
  | 0 -> 1
  | n -> n-1;;
val f : int -> int = <fun>
```
Warning: OCaml toplevel block without trailing ;; detected in file 'test-case.md'.
Non-semicolon terminated phrases are deprecated.
In MDX 3.0 support for toplevel blocks without ;; will be removed.
