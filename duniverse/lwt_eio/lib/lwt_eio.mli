val with_event_loop : clock:#Eio.Time.clock -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_event_loop ~clock fn] starts an Lwt event loop running and then executes [fn ()].
    When that finishes, the event loop is stopped. *)

module Promise : sig
  val await_lwt : 'a Lwt.t -> 'a
  (** [await_lwt p] allows an Eio fibre to wait for a Lwt promise [p] to be resolved,
      much like {!Eio.Promise.await} does for Eio promises.
      This can only be used while the event loop created by {!with_event_loop} is still running. *)

  val await_eio : 'a Eio.Promise.t -> 'a Lwt.t
  (** [await_eio p] allows a Lwt thread to wait for an Eio promise [p] to be resolved.
      This can only be used while the event loop created by {!with_event_loop} is still running. *)

  val await_eio_result : 'a Eio.Promise.or_exn -> 'a Lwt.t
  (** [await_eio_result] is like [await_eio], but allows failing the lwt thread too. *)
end

val run_eio : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a Lwt.t 
(** [run_eio fn] allows running Eio code from within a Lwt function.
    It runs [fn ()] in a new Eio fibre and returns a promise for the result.
    The new fibre is attached to the Lwt event loop's switch and will be
    cancelled if the function passed to {!with_event_loop} returns. *)

val notify : unit -> unit
(** [notify ()] causes [Lwt_engine.iter] to return,
    indicating that the event loop should run the hooks and resume yielded threads.
    Ideally, you should call this when an Eio fibre wakes up a Lwt thread, e.g. by resolving a Lwt promise.
    In most cases however this isn't really needed,
    since [Lwt_unix.yield] is deprecated and [Lwt.pause] will call this automatically. *)
